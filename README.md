# rinha-2004-1

* Using Quarkus
* Using Crabzilla (so far, published only to jitpack)
* Using Event Sourcing (not so competitive in terms of performance)

# TODO

* Publish to Docker
* Test it, get feedback and finx/tune it
* Enjoy

# How to run

* `docker-compose up`             # to start postgres
* `mvn compile quarkus:dev`       # to start app
